# 📘 Sahayak AI

**An AI-powered Classroom Assistant for Grades 6–8**
Empowering teachers and students through automation, AI enrichment, and intelligent scheduling using **AWS Bedrock**, **Lambda**, and **Firebase**.



---

## 🎯 Overview

Sahayak AI is a cloud-based educational assistant designed for **Indian middle schools**. It helps teachers automate lesson scheduling, worksheet generation, assignment evaluation, and student performance analysis — all powered by AWS and AI agents.

The project was developed as part of a hackathon to demonstrate **autonomous AI behavior** using AWS services and Bedrock, showcasing real-world educational impact.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. 🗓 Scheduled Content Delivery

* Teachers upload content and define duration.
* AI agent (EventBridge + Bedrock) enriches material with YouTube links.
* One subject delivered daily (~40–60 mins workload).
* Students receive email notifications on delivery.

**AWS Services:** Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Bedrock, Textract,Translate Nodemailer.

---

### 2. 🧠 Worksheet Generation

* Teachers upload files + instructions (difficulty, question type, count).
* Bedrock generates MCQs, short/long questions aligned with NCERT.
* Output as Word/PDF, stored in S3 for download.

**AWS Services:** Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Bedrock,Textract.

---

### 3. 🧾 Assignment Scheduling & Evaluation

* Teachers schedule assignments stored in DynamoDB.
* Teacher receives the modal answer with points were grades will be
  awarded he can edit modify the modal answer and agent will evaluate
  on that Basis
* Students submit via Google Forms/Docs stored in S3.
* Lambda parses responses, Bedrock evaluates answers.
* Grades stored in DynamoDB and emailed to parents.

**AWS Services:** Lambda, Bedrock, S3, DynamoDB, Nodemailer.

---

### 4. 🪄 Content Enhancer

* Teachers upload notes (Word/PDF).
* Bedrock enriches content: simplify, elaborate, or visualize.
* Returns editable enhanced content.

**AWS Services:** Lambda, Bedrock, S3,Dynamo DB, Step Function .

---

### 5. 📊 Student Performance Analytics

* Aggregates test and assignment data from DynamoDB.
* Displays per-student and per-class trends.

**AWS Services:** DynamoDB, Lambda, S3.

---

## 🌟 Mini Features

1. **Parent Reports** – Nodemailer sends weekly performance summaries.
2. **Doubt Solver** – Students submit questions → Bedrock answers → unresolved queries flagged for teacher review and also Supported by rag powered by vector DB.
3. **Automated Notifications** – EventBridge + Lambda trigger email alerts for every scheduled upload, assignment, or test.

## 🧠 Autonomous Agent Behavior

Sahayak AI operates autonomously once teachers upload content:

1. **Schedules delivery** using EventBridge.
2. **Enriches** with YouTube learning links.
3. **Notifies** students via email.
4. **Evaluates** submissions automatically.
5. **Generates** reports without manual intervention.

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+ and Python 3.9+
* AWS CLI configured
* Firebase project + service credentials
* IAM permissions for Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, SES

### 🪜 Steps

#### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sahayakai.git
cd sahayakai
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root with:

```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=sahayak-study-packs
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<your_service_email>
SMTP_USER=<your_email>
SMTP_PASS=<your_app_password>
```

#### 4. Run Frontend (React)

```bash
npm  start
```

#### 5. Deploy Lambda Functions

You can deploy manually or use the Serverless Framework:

```bash
cd Lambda-Functions
serverless deploy
```

#### 6. Setup EventBridge Rules

Schedule rules for autonomous content delivery:

```bash
aws events put-rule --schedule-expression "rate(1 day)" --name sahayak-daily-delivery
```

## 🧪 Testing & Demo Preparation

| Component       | Test Method                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Upload  | Upload sample file → Check S3 + DynamoDB entry             |
| Worksheet Gen   | Run Lambda `generateWorksheet` manually → Check output doc |
| Assignment Eval | Submit Word file(Solution) → Observe Bedrock evaluation JSON       |
| Notifications   | Check student & parent email delivery                      |
| Dashboard       | View updated metrics in the app                            |
